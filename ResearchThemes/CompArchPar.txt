Paragraph About Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is essentially a blueprint for the software and hardware, and how they all interact together. This includes the functionality, organisation, and implementation of computer systems.
Computer Architecture is the building blocks to the entire It industry. If new technologies emerge then computer architecture will have to change, resulting in both hardware and software changes.
